# devcontainer_demo_golang

A sample golang project uses [devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers)

[My blog](https://wu101.com/blog/devcontainer-the-introduction/) uses it to talk about devcontainers.

# Start project in devcontainer

`Devcontainer` allows you to write code in a full-feature containerized development environment:

1. Ensure Docker is installed and running
2. Install [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and `Dev Containers` extension
3. Open this project in vscode
4. Launch `Command Palette` from the UI or run `âŒ˜ + Shift + P` if you are on Mac
5. Select either `Reopen in Container` or `Rebuild Container` to start the Devcontainer
